//when we use enum ?
//when we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time
//that mean if you see enum the value very related to each other
//we also use enum when the value are not going to change
//we use enum when we want to signal to other engineers that this is a collection of very closely related values

//at the end if your data small and not change use enum
